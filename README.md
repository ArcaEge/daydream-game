# Blobbow Knight
A game we made for [Daydream Cambridge](https://daydream.hackclub.com/cambridge). It was based off of the theme: _Sacrifice_  
We had a lot fun making this game and it was a first time experience of Godot for @spacexplorer11 !  
You can check it out at [itch.io](https://arcaege.itch.io/blobbow-knight)
## How to play
You can play the game using WASD + `Space` to jump. In order to progress, you must _Sacrifice_. If you _Sacrifice_ yourself, a ghost will spawn, allowing you to cross the danger.
